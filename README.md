# Advent of Code 2022

https://adventofcode.com/2022

Days will have implementations in Rust, Python, or both depending how much time
I had that day. The goal is to play around and see just how painful (or not) it
is to prototype in Rust vs Python on smaller apps like this.

## Add a new challenge folder
```
make day05
```

## Run the Rust code
```
cd day05
cargo run --bin part1 -- [arg] ...
```

## Run the Python code
```
cd day05
python part1.py
```

## Requirements
* Python 3.11
* Rust 2021 (1.64.0)
